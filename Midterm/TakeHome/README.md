# Implementation
* The client is sending server the sensor number of which it needs data
* Since a delay of 2sec is present after every reading by a sensor, a delay of 2 sec is present after collecting data from server

# Files uploaded
* client.c is the client code
* server.c is the server code
* sensor_data.csv is an sample output obtained for running the above two codes for 150 timestamps

### Note
simulator.py uploaded on LMS is used for creating sensor data
